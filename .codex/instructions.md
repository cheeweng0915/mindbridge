# Karpathy Guidelines (Codex)

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1) Think Before Coding
- State assumptions explicitly; if uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them.
- Push back when a simpler approach exists.
- If unclear, stop and ask for clarification.

## 2) Simplicity First
- Write the minimum code that solves the request.
- No speculative features or abstractions.
- No configurability that was not requested.
- If code is more complex than needed, simplify.

## 3) Surgical Changes
- Touch only what is required by the request.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Match existing style.
- Clean up only unused code introduced by your changes.

## 4) Goal-Driven Execution
- Define success criteria before coding.
- Prefer testable goals (repro test, then fix; failing test, then pass).
- For multi-step tasks, state concise steps and verification checks.
